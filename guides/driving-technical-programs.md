## Identify the problem and make sure it is well and widely understood
Initiatives can come from different sources. For example, planning, a customer need, or an executive request. Regardless of where they come from, initiatives aim to solve a problem. Before you jump to solving a problem, you must start by understanding every detail. You will need to learn more about the initiative and the problem we are trying to solve so you can drive clarity.  _At this point, your role as the program owner is to reduce the ambiguity associated with the initiative and create a concise problem statement that drives clarity around what we want to achieve. Most of the time, you may only know "directionally" what the organization wants to accomplish with the initiative and whether it is a program._

Start by asking, "what do we want to achieve?" and "why?". Talk with the requesters, preliminary stakeholders, domain experts, and other key partners to get and answer these questions. Do not stop until you have a satisfactory answer to these questions. Then, write down your new understanding of the problem and the outcomes you want to achieve with the initiative. Socialize your writing and ideas with stakeholders and domain experts to ensure everyone understands the problem in the same way and create alignment on the initiative's outcomes. Remember that you want to build a shared understanding of the problem.

### Define metrics and picture success
One of the most critical pieces to ensuring understanding of the problem comes with defining a picture of success and its associated metrics. The picture of success answers the question “How do we know that we have successfully solved the problem?” or “What will be the state after solving the problem?”. Stakeholders, partners, and domain experts must agree on the picture of success and how to measure it before you consider your problem widely understood. People will challenge you if you miss a connection between your problem, your supporting data and metrics, and the mechanisms your solution uses to move the metric. 

Remember that we do not operate in a vacuum. There must be a relationship between the initiative’s metrics and success and the top-level OKRs, which answers the question, “How does this initiative impact the OKR?”.

### Identify risks and clarify assumptions
It is likely that as you discover more and more facts and facets of the problem at hand, you make assumptions and also undercover risks to its success. Thoroughly document these assumptions and make sure the risks are well defined. If necessary, seek additional help to understand the risks and their impact on the initiative and its picture of success.  While identifying risks, keep an eye on unknown unknowns and develop preliminary mitigation strategies for your known risks. The more you know about the problem space, the more risks you will uncover.

### Share the problem understanding, risks, assumptions, etc. as widely as possible
At this stage, you must cover the largest possible surface and over-communicate the understanding of the problem and its outcomes.  Share your ideas with a broader audience early and let individuals decide when to bring a new partner to broaden the program's reach.  Emphasize transparency and openness, and make your documents, research, and other artifacts, such as meeting notes, available to everyone that wants to see them (respecting confidentiality if necessary).

**Pro tip**: At this point, the ownership of who should lead the program may be muddy. Use this step to find an owner for the whole initiative (hint: it doesn’t need to be you, just because you are unearthing the problem doesn’t mean you need to own it). The owner should take action starting from step two and actively participate in step one.

#### Outcomes
* High-quality description of the problem and clarity around what you want to achieve with the initiative
* Consensus with stakeholders on what the problem is, and who should be involved in solving the problem
* The problem, metrics, and assumptions are widely understood


## Identify work owners and dependencies
Now that everyone understands the problem you are trying to solve and the target outcomes, it is time to look for owners and dependencies. Start by asking yourself, “Am I the right person to own this initiative?” and “Should the solution to the problem be structured as a program?”. If the potential solution to the problem is a small or large project for a single team, then most likely, the answer to the first and second questions is “No”.

At this stage, you and the new initiative owner should identify dependencies and the next steps. For large programs, you want to engage with all the teams who need to contribute to a solution and get them bought into the problem space. You should also engage the engineers who may work on the solution, get them involved in refining the problem definition, and be excited about their work. Engage staff and senior staff engineers to get their points of view and discover new blind spots. For each team you engage with, get their commitment and ensure they will stay engaged throughout the program.

If you are launching a new product or introducing new functionalities that require marketing, customer support, and operations, do not forget to include them in the early phases of your program. Connect with legal and security to ensure early mitigation of legal, compliance, regulatory, and security risks and requirements.

**Pro-tip:** If you are not the owner of the resulting project (be it a program or not), you should still work with the program owner and help them create a plan. As we advance, you will still be involved with the project in an advisory role.

### Outcomes:
* The initiative owner has identified and contacted the teams and partners that will be involved in the solution
* Problem-solving dependencies are identified, and know of the upcoming work request
* It is clear whether the initiative is a program or not and whether you should drive it

## 3. Create an execution plan and create “execution” clarity
So far, you have clarified the problem and identified your program dependencies. Now it is time to create an execution plan, align expectations, and set delivery outcomes for each team that participates in the program. Each team that contributes to the solution is accountable for delivering and creating a detailed plan that outlines their execution strategy. You are responsible for defining those outcomes and clarifying the expectations, boundaries, assumptions, and timelines. Work with the teams to find the right time to address the problem and drive a timely discussion. As you get things in place, new risks will arise, dependencies, and inputs that may cause you to assess the problem.

When crafting the plan, write a one-pager for each team you have identified as contributors. It should outline the outcomes of their contribution to the program. Make an explicit link between their deliverables and goals, the program goals, and the ultimate product line goals. Then, work with the teams to start from the outcomes and clarify their scoping and resourcing. Ensure that you ask for approximate estimates, not necessarily high fidelity timelines and that they will have time to refine their estimates. Use this time to build trust with the teams, and follow through with the commitments. Introduce as much transparency as possible on how you communicate estimates as part of the overall plan. Use this opportunity to update your known risks and new risks the contributing teams have identified (especially those that may make the estimates inaccurate). Set preliminary delivery milestones that align with the outcomes and program goals.

All along the way, share the plan with your stakeholders and create mechanisms to enable changes and modifications. Remember, your plan must include work items, key metrics, and a picture of success (or success criteria). 

Pro tip: As soon as you have a plan, share it with your stakeholders and leadership. Expect critical feedback and be open to change your assumptions, action plan, and estimates based on this feedback.

### Communication and program updates
Communication and transparency will reinforce the program's perception and clarify its what, when, how, and who. Adapt your communication style to the audience you are addressing, do not assume that everyone (executives, middle managers, and engineers) will understand the same type of communication. In general, be very crisp, concise, and goal-oriented with executives. Talk about outcomes, sequence of work, risks, and status. Remember that the higher you go on the corporate ladder, executives have less time and attention for each initiative. Engineers like technical details and will get bored with lots of outcome-related verbiages. Instead, talk technical and concrete with engineers.

While creating the program execution plan, ensure that you have reached agreements on the type of communication, frequency and medium to communicate updates. Establish a clear understanding of the different statuses you will use throughout the program and verify that every stakeholder and participating team agrees with them. For example, define what yellow, green, and red mean. This is the right time to determine the frequency of check-ins. Sometimes, you will need to set up a weekly check-in (scrum of scrum style), and at other times you will need to breathe on the neck of some teams to drive delivery (participate in their daily standup). There is no rule of thumb; just make sure that everyone knows your level of engagement and what to expect. 

**Pro tip:** some programs will require a high degree of executive engagement; in those cases, over-communicating with flash reports and custom report emails may be the best course of action. Go as far as setting weekly executive check-ins to ascertain the program’s progress. In any case, think twice before scheduling large-venue costly meetings that will provide little value.

Once you have finalized your plan and its companion roadmap, give each team, staff/senior staff engineers, and stakeholder a chance to review it, update estimates, timelines, risks assessment, and resources. Some revisions will come from this review, so make sure you allocate time to address concerns and changes to the overall plan.

After you have completed this step, you will have confirmation of who will do what and when. Everyone involved in the program must agree with the commitments in the plan. Remember that every team is responsible for their commitments and explaining deviations to their plan. _You have memorialized the commitments and are ready to execute your program._

**Note:** while each team is responsible for and accountable for delivering their portion of the program, you are the program's overall owner and goals. You are responsible for clarifying ownership, helping people resolve disputes, and making things move forward. Also, you have a privileged view of the program and the organization, and it is your responsibility to use that view to ensure the systemic soundness of the program.

### Outcomes
* Each team must have clarity on what they need to do and by when. A one-pager that describes the outcomes and expectations of each team in the program.

* All teams who contribute to the program have committed to a timeline, identified and negotiated their dependencies (upstream and downstream), and identified risks to their contributions. A roadmap, which outlays the plan, who (team) will do what, who are the owners, and when the deliverables are due.

* Agreement with stakeholders on the optimal medium of communication, frequency, and meaning of statuses for the program.

## Execute and deliver

### Communication
Communication is paramount while executing, you must insist on tracking progress, receive updates, and handle roadblocks. You will act as the communication hub and handle escalations or escalate when necessary – with an emphasis on clean escalations. Drive your program as if it was a glassbox and create as much transparency as possible. Provide routine and consistent status updates, and make all the program artifacts widely available, your goal is to proactively avoid the question “what is going on”.  Communicate risks and the likeliness of them happening as well as their potential impact on the program outcomes and the mitigation plans.

Be specific and remove as much ambiguity as possible from your communication. Consider the audience that will read your emails and status reports, they may have hundreds of emails to read, and hundreds of slack messages to catch up with.

Pro tip: Document and memorialize as much as possible. After each meeting create meeting notes that document decisions, action items, owners, etc. Make notes, and other documentation to everyone involved in the project, doing so will help you build trust with the teams and your stakeholders.

### Flexibility
All along the execution of your plan remember that no plan is perfect and often you will have to adjust your plan. When something changes, ensure that the changes are well understood by the participating teams as well as the reasons for the change. 

### Accountability
Each action item must have an owner. Ensure that you and the teams promptly identify owners for each action item and commitment they take. Also, ensure that owners have time to review and commit to them. You should guarantee that callouts and blockers do not come as a surprise to the owner of the issue, especially before you send a status update.

### Ruthless prioritization
Things will change while executing the program, and priorities will change, teams may lose people, your budget will run out of money, new priorities will arise, etc. You will need to understand what is changing, how it impacts your program and push back appropriately. Do not accept that a priority changes as truth. Instead, challenge assumptions, evaluate the rationale behind them, and ensure that everyone understands the value delivered in the program (and how it competes against the new priority). If you think that a decision is wrong, memorialize it, escalate and use your data to convince leadership otherwise.

Pro tip: there is a saying that goes, “no plan survives the contact with reality”. The assertion is true most of the time, and as such, you should feel comfortable adapting and updating your plans accordingly.

### Tracking progress and metrics
Start your execution by knowing the baseline values for the metrics you will be tracking. Ensure that everyone understands the program success criteria, how the metrics connect to it, and how they show progress. Repeat this all along the program’s execution to avoid losing sight of your end objective. Tracking metrics is essential because they give you a measure of progress and indicate whether your program is incomplete or not addressing its primary objective.

Note: most often than not, the metrics you need won’t be available from the start, and you will need to build the means to collect and evaluate them. Make sure you include this step in your plan.

### Operational Excellence
While creating software, you must ensure that each team includes operational excellence on their plans and follow through on it. For example, you may verify the implementation of logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms, the creation of runbooks and maintenance procedures, and that tech debt and technical risks get appropriately and promptly identified and documented.

Pro tip: trust and verify! When teams complete a piece of work and get ready to deliver, you must trust that they have produced the outcomes agreed upon, but you must also verify those outcomes. Verifying means inspecting test execution, code commits, deployment descriptors, runbooks, etc.

### Outcomes
* The plan was executed “successfully” and the solution and outcomes delivered
* The program achieved its picture of success - from a software delivery perspective

## Delivery and tying up loose ends!
You have not fully delivered a program until you have met the success criteria, designated long-term owners, and created the process and structure to ensure the long-term success of the solution delivered by the program.

Part of wrapping up your program includes following up on post-launch/post-delivery work items such as marketing campaigns, support documentation, structure, adoption tracking, incentives, etc. The list will change depending on the nature of the program, but the goal here is to ensure that non-engineering delivery-related tasks get the attention they deserve.

As the onwer driving the program, it is your responsibility to set the program solution for long-term success, including evolutions and corrective updates. Usually, the organization supporting product structure will have a process and framework for tracking and fixing bugs, capturing customer evolutions, and performing adequate updates. If there are no processes to support these activities, you should do the legwork to set them up. 

When you deliver the program, you will no longer be accountable for it; however, you need to find long-term owners for the delivered solution in product, engineering, and design. These owners will be responsible for the sustained maintenance and evolution of the solution.

At this point, you will have delivered a successful program that solves a real and impactful customer problem! The final step consists of recording the challenges and learnings you faced during these steps and sharing them with your immediate team and the larger community.

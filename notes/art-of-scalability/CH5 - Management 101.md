# Management 101

### What is management?

Management is "the conduction or supervising of something" and as the "judicious use of means to accomplish an end."... "and ethical use of means to accomplish and end".

If leadership is a promise, then management is action. If leadership is a destination, then management is the direction. If leadership if inpsiration, then management is motivation. Leadership pulls, management pushes.

Management includes the activities of measuring, goal evaluation, and metric creation. It also includes the personnel responsibilities of staffing, personnel evaluation, and team construction.. Management includes all the activities one might typically consider project management, such as driving team to work completion, setting aggressive dates, and so on.

###  A good Manager

The best managers have an eye for detail and are incredibly task and goal oriented. Upon being given a task or goal, they can unpack that task or goal into everyhting that needs to happen for it to be successful. This activity involves more than actions; it requires communication, organizational structure, appropriate compensation, logistics, and capital to be successful. 

Managers develope a variety of people skills that help them get the most ou of the individuals within their organizations. The very best managers don't describe themselves as having a specific style, but rather theu might need to employ any number of approaches to motivate certain individuals.

Some people respond best to terse descriptions and matter-of-fact approaches, whereas others prefer a bit of nurturing and emotional support. Soem people need a taskmaster; still others require a den mother.

### Project and Task management

Good managers get projects done on time and on budget, and meet the expectations of shareholder value creation. Great managers do the same things even in the face of adversity. Both achieve their goals by decomposing them into concrete supporting tasks. They then enlist appropriate help both inside an outside the organization and continually measure progress. 

=> Adopt a mindset where everyone in the organization works for the same customer. No more, you are customer of mine mindset.

We have never seen a project run exactly as initially envisioned within the first iteration of a project plan. While project planning is important, the value it creates lies not in the initial plan but rather in the exercise of thinking through the project and possible paths.

"5-95 rule": Spend 5% of your time developing an adequate, defensible and detailed plan -- but also recognize that this plan will not survive contact with the enemy and devote the remaining 95% of your time to "war gaming" the plan to come up with contingencies.  => Don't increase yout total time spend planning, instead reallocate your time according to the 5-95 rule.

### Building teams: a sport analogy

The right team today might not be the right team for the next season.

Our jobs as managers and executives are really not different than the jobs of coaches of professional football teams. Our salary caps are the budgets that are developed by the executive management team and are reviewed and approved by our boards of directors.

We must constantly look for the best talent available at a price that we can afford. Yet, most of us don't actively manage the skills, people, and composition of our teams, ultimately short-changing our company and our shareholders.

Efficiensy is a measurement of getting more for the same amount of money or more for less money. Scaling with people is then a function both of the individual people, the number of people, and the organization of people.

Remember that a decision not do do something is the sa as deciding to do something. Ignoring something that should be done is a decision not to do it.

If you have not spend time with your team for weeks on end, you have decided not to spend time with them---

To get our jobs done, we must have the best talent possible given our board-authorized budget. We must constantly evaluate and coach our teams to ensure that each member is adding value appropriate to his or her level of compensation, find new high performing talent, and coach the great people we have to achieve even higher performance.  


### Upgrading teams: a garden analogy

Our team is a garde, and our garden expects more of us than having manure thrown on it from time to time. The scalability of our organization is largely tied to how great our talent is on a per-person basis and how consistent their behaviour are with our corporate culture.

Gardens should be thoughtfully designed, and the same is true of our teams. We evaluate how the different plants and flwoers will interact. We should do the same with out teams. Will certain team members steal too many nutrients? Will the soil (our culture) properly support their needs? Should the garden be full of only bright and brilliant flowers or will it be more pleasing with robust and healthy foliage to support flowers?

Managers in hyper-growth companies often spend a lot of time interviewwing and selecting candidates, but usually very little time on a per-candidate basis. Event worse, these managers often don;t take the time to determine where they've fone wrong with past hiring decisions and what they've done well in certain decisions.

All too often, though, we interview for skills but overlook critical items like cultural or team fit. -> Why have you had to remove people? Why have people decided to leave?

Paying attention to the needs of the organization from a productivity and quality perspective. Do you need another engineer or product manager, or do inefficiencies in the company's operations indicate the need for additional process definition, tools engineers, or quality assurance personnel?

Interview the person to make certain that he or she will be a good fit with your culture and that the individual's behaviors are consistent with the behavioral expectations of the company.

Feeding your garden means spending time growing your team. Of all the practices involved in tending to your team, this is the one that is most often overlooked for lack of time. The intent of feeding is to grow the members of your team who are producing to the expectations of your shareholders. Feeding consist of coaching, praising, correcting technique or approach, adjusting compensation and equity, and anything else that creates a stronger and more productive employee. 

Feeding your garden also measn taking individuals who might not be performing well in certain position and putting them into positions where they can thrive. If you find yourslef moving an employee more than once, it is likely that you are avoiding the appropriate action of weeding.

Raising the bar on the team overall and helping employees achieve greater levels of success. Great teams enjoy aggressive but achievable challenges, and it is your job as a manager to challenge them to be the best they can be.

Invest as much as possible in seeding and feeding, we all know that underperforming and nonperforming individuals choke team productivity. The nutrients in this case are the time that you spend attempting to coach underperforming individuals to an acceptanle performance level and the time your tieam spends compensating for an underperforming individual's poor results.

Although you must abide by your company;s practices regarding the removal of people who are not performing, it is vital that you find ways to quickly remove personnel who are keeping you and the rest of your team from achieving your objectives. The sooner you remove the poor performers, the sooner you can find appropriate replacements and get your team moving forward.

Performance as a reason for termination, you should always include an evaluation of the person's behaviors. Sometimes one individual within an organization may create more and get more done than any other team member, yet exhibit actions and behaviors that bring down total team output. Obvious when an employee is creating a hostile work environment, but less so when an employee simply does not work well with others.

Two dimensional axis with defined actions, such as that depicted in the figure below. The x-axis here is the behavior of the employee and the y-axis is the employee's performance. Many employee revews, when done properly, identify the actions on the y-axis, but they may not consider the impact of the behavioural x-axis.
```                    
                    ^
                    | Great performance/ Bad behaviour         | Great Performance/ Great Behaviour        | Superior
                    | Coach or "feed" - is unsuccessful, weed  | Feed! Target for new Hires                |  
Performance         | ---------------------------------------  | ----------------------------------------- |  
                    | Poor Performance/ Bad behaviour          | Poor Performance / Great Behaviour        |
                    | Weed immediately                         | Coach or "Feed" -- If unsuccessful, weed  |
                    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
        Unsatisfactory                              Behaviour

```

One thing that we have learned over time is that you will always wish you had acted earlier in removing underperformers. Don't wast time agonizing over whether you are acting too quickly -- that never happens. You will always wish you had acted even sooner when you have completed the termination.

### The cultural interview

* Make a list of your company's beliefs regarding people. They may be printed on the back of your identification badge or posted on your intranet. Identify questions around these beliefs and distribute them to interview team members.
* Identify interviewers who are both high performers within your team and a good match with the culture, beliefs, and behaviors of your company.
* Gather all interviewers after the interview and discuss the responses to the questions and the feeling of the team.

### Seed, Feed, and weed to succeed

* _Seeding_ is the addition of new and better talent to the organization.
* _Feeding_ is the development of the people within the organization we want to retain.
* _Weeding_ is the removal of underperforming individuals within the organization.

### Measurement, Metrics, adn Goal evaluation

"You can't improve that which you do not measure."  The themes we most often recommend to track scale are cost, availability/response times, engineering productivity and efficiency, and quality.

_cost of scale_ as both a percentage of total engineering spending and a cost per transaction.

The measurement of response time should be compared to the absolute service level agreement (SLA), even if the agreement remains unpublished. The measurement should be performed using actual end-user transactions rather than proxies for their interactions.  

Engineering productivity and efficiency is another important measurement. With improved productivity you expect to produce more products and complete more initiatives at an equivalent cost to the latter, or that it will start to produce the same products at lower cost. 

If we produce more, by allocating an equivalent percentage of our engineering team, we can get more done more quickly and thereby reduce future scale demands on the engineering team.

The real trick in figuring out how to measure engineering productivity and efficiency is to split it up into at least two components.
The first part addresses whether your engineering teams are using as much of the available engineering days as possible for engineering-related tasks.
The second part of engineering productivity and efficiency focuses on measuring how much you get out of each of your engineering days. This is much harder exercise, as it requires you to choose among a set of unattractive options. You might product 100 lines of code per engineer per day, but what if you really need to write only 10 lines to get the same job done?

Quality rounds out our scalability management measurement suite. Quality can have a positive or negative impact on manu other measirements. Poor product quality can cause scalability issues on the production environment and, as a result, can increase downtime and decrease availability. Poor product quality increases cost and reduces productivity and efficiency.

### The goal Tree

Easiest way to map organizational goals to company goals is through a goal tree and a goal hierarchy,.

### Paving the path for success
 Manager: being equal parts taskmaster, tactician, gardener, and measurement guru. A manager who allows a team to struggle unnecessarily over rough terrain on the way to an objective when he or she can easily pave the way, it is willfully reducing the output of the team. This reduction in output means the team can't scale efficiently, as less work is applied to the end goal. Less efficiency means lower sharehodler return for an invenstment.

_Bulldozed_ is rather and aggressive term.Although that type of aggressive play might be required from time to time, employing it will likely damage your reputation as a desirable and cooperative colleague. Managers are responsible for removing obstacles in the road to the success of an organization and its objectives.

Real obstacles are issues that arise and that the team is not equipped to handle.When encountering these kind of obstacles, remember that the team isn't working _for_ you but rather _with_ you.


Management is about execution and all of the activities necessary to realize the organization's goals, objectives, and vision while adhering to its mission.

### In Summary

* Management is the judicious and ethical use of means to accomplish an end.
* As with leadership, the pursuit of management excellence is a lifelong goal and as much a journey as it is a definition.
* Like leadership, amangement can be viewed as a function consisting of personal characteristics, skills, experiences, actions, and approaches. Increasing any aspect of these elements increases your management "quotient".
* Forget about "management style" and instead learn to adapt to the needs of your team, your company, and your mission. Project and task management is critical to successful management. These activities require the ability to decompose a goal into components parts, determine the relationship among those parts, assign ownership with dates, and measure progress based on those dates.
* Spend 5% of your project management time creating detailed project plans and 95% of your time developing contigencies to those plans. Focus on achieving results in an appropriate time frame, rather than laboring to fit activities to the intial plan.
* People and organization management is broken into "seeding, feeding, and weeding"
 * Seeding is the hiring of people into an organization with the goal of getting better and better people. Most managers spend too little time on the interview process and don;t aim high enough. Cultural and behavioural interviewing should be included when looking to seed new employees.
 * Feeding is the development of people within an organization. We can never spend enough time giving quality feedback to our employees.
 * Weeding is the elimination of underperforming people within an organization. It is rarely done "soon enough" although we should always feel obligated to give someone performance-related feedback first.
* We can't improve what we don't measure. Scalability measurements should include measurements of availability, response time, engineering productivity, and efficiency, cost, and quality.
* Goal trees are effective for mapping organizational goals to company goals and help create a "causal roadmap to success".
* Managers are responsible for paving the path to success. The most successful managers see themselves as critical parts of their teams working towards a common goal.

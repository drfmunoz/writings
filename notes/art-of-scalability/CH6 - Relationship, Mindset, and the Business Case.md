# Relationship, Mindset, and the Business case

* Building effective business leaders/product team Relationship
* Having the right "mindset" to build products
* Making the business case for product scalability improvements

We believe that a great many of the problems existing between many general managers and their technical teams are a result of vast and widening chasm in education and experience.
"Without trust, the team is doomed"

Without some previous relathionship, communication does not happen on mutual footing. Questions are often rightfully asked from a business perspective, and the answers are often given in technical terms.

Missmatch in communication quite often gives way to more a detrimental form of communication, which we call _destructive interference_. Questions begin to be aseked in a finger-pointing fashion, such as "What are you doing to keep this on track?" or "How did you let it slip a week?" rather than in a fashion meant to resolve issues early, such as "Let us see if we can work together to determine how we can get the project back on the timeline".

It is possible to both have high standard s and actually be a participative, supporting, and helpful leader and executive.


### Why the Business Executive Might be the problem

Questions to determine whether the culprit of poor communication is the business executive.

* Has the header of technology been replaced more than once?
* Do different people in the technology team given the business leaders the same explanations but they are still not believed?
* Do business leaders spend as much time attempting to understand technology as they have invested in leaderning to read financial statements?
* Do the business leaders understand how to ask questions to know whether dates are both aggressive and achievable?
* Does the business executive spend time in the beginning of a product life cycle figuring out how to measure success?
* Do business leaders lead by example or do they point fingers?

Questions can be easily traced back to education and experience. If you are getting consistent answers from your team, perhaps you just do not understand what they are saying. Solutions: Either you can gain a better understanding of what they are telling you, or you can work with them so that they communicate in a language that you better understand.

### Why the Technology executive might be the problem

Questions to ask your technology leadership:

* Does the technology team provide early feedback on the likelihood of making key dates?
* Is that feedback consistently incorrect?
* Is the business repreatedly experiencing the same problems either in production or in product schedules?
* Do the technology team members measure their work against metrics that are meaningful to the business?
* Are the technology choices couched in terms of business benefit rather than technical merit?
* Does the technology team understand what drives the business, who the competitors are, and how their business will be successful?
* Does the technology team understand the business challenges, risks, obstacles, and strategy?
* Can the technology leadership read and understand the balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and income statement?

Technology executives who simply haven't learned the language of business. The best technology executives define metrics in terms of things that are important to the business: revenue, profit, cost, time to market, barriers to entry, customer retention, and so on.

CTOs successful in that role must find ways to significantly increase their business acumen.

### Defeating the IT mindset

There are two models of operation: The IT organizational model and the product organizational model.

#### IT Organizations

IT Organizations: often provide consultation and implementation services to other organizations for the purpose of decreasing costs, increasing employee productivity, and so on. They focus on implementing enterprise resource planning, communication systems, and customer relationship management solutions. They speak in terms of "solution" rather than products, and work to elicit a set of requirements from internal customers to implement packaged or homegrown solutions to meet organizational objectives. IT Groups are often viewed as cost centers and are run accordingly. Their primary objectives are to reduce the cost bass of the company by employing technology solutions rather than by expanding headcount to similar activities. 

IT organizations are evaluated on their cost to the enterprise. It can cost as a percentage of revenue, as a percentage of total operating (non-gross margin) costs, or on a cost-per-employee (per capita) basis within the company. Most companies need an IT group, and being an IT organizatoin is a great way to contribute to a company and to help generate shareholder value.


#### Product Organizations 

Product organizations define and create the products that drive growth and shareholder value creation. Because their mission is different from that of IT org, product teams function, act, and think differently than their peers in IT. Rather than primaily being evaluated on a cost basis, product teams are viewed as profit centers. It is relevant only in the evaluating the revenue and profit that the cost delivers. IT teams often see their customers as being other employees,  product teams are focused on external market analysis, and they see their customers as being the users of the products created by the company.

Tech Companies such as Google, Amazin, eBay, etc. understand in their DNA that technology is part of their product and that their product is their business. These companies do not attempt to use IT metrics or IT approaches to develop their products. The product and executive teams understand that the customer is the outside person purchasing their solutions, not someone within thier own company. Business leaders use terms like "product architecture" rather than "enterprise architecture". They seek to isolate faults within the products they create rather than looking for how to share resources (and failures) for the purpose of reducing costs.

Real problems emerge when a company creates a product for real customers but does so using processes meant for internal IT organizations. The documentation of requiremetns built into this approach tends to kill the notion of product discovery.

Top-down innovation from internal customers eliminates the advantages of broad-spectrum sourcing of innovation. Companies continue to seek internal solutions rather than sensing their market and reacting to how customers interact with their products. 

The IT mindsets are great for internal technology developmetn, but disastrous for external product development.

Great product are built by companies that understand their customers. Grate product teams innovate with their customers directly, rather than eliciting requirements from other employees. Great product companies understand the difference between running teams that create externally focused products and those that create internally focused efficiencies.


### The business case for scale

No one cares the project upon which you want to embark is the newest and greates technolgy available. Your job is to explain how and why it will maximize shareholder value by maximizing revenue and minimizing costs.

Let's take a pass at how we might frame the business case for investing in higher avlability. Downtime usually means lost revenue and/or unhappy customers. => Calculate the revenue lost associated with any downtime on a per-minte or per-page basis.

Another idea for describin the outages or potential for outages in business terms is to translate it into costs within the organization.


### Summary

* An experiential chasm separates technologists and other business leaders due to education and experiences taht are missing from most nontechnology executives' careers.
* Technologiests must take responsibility for crossing over into the business to bridge this chasm.
* To garner support and to understand scaling, initiatives must be pout in terms that the business leaders can understand.
* Calculating the cost of outages and downtime can be an effective method of demonstrating the need for a business culture focused on scalability.

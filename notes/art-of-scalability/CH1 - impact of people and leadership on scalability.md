## CH 1: impact of people and leadership on scalability

Important factors: people processes and technology. People are the most important.

People design, code, and configure the systems that run our products and are solely responsible for any defects in design, code or configuration.

### Why people?

"The simple most important piece to get rights if you hope to scale a product" -> Without people, you will never have scalability problems. Never develop a product that needs to scale.

Greates successes in bluilding scalable products have at their heart a great set of people making may great decisions and every once in a while a few poor choices.

People are the heart and brains behind scalability, it makes sense that we should spend a great deal of time and effort on attracting and retaining the best folks available. You must have the right person, with the right behaviors, in the right job, at the right time.

Need the right person and the right behavior at the right time.

**Right person**: right knowledge, skills and abilities. Right job at the right time, ensure that he/she can be successful in that position and create the most shareholder value possible while tending to his or her career. 

**Right behavior**: preson works and plays well with others while adhering to the culture and values of the company. Bad behavious are as valid reasons for removing a person from the team as not having the required skills.

### Why organization?

Understand our desired outcomes.  Questions to consider regarding how organizational structure can prositively or negatively impact the desired outcomes:

* how easily can I add or remove people to/from this organization? Do I need to add them in groups or can I add individual people?
* Does the organizational structure help or hinder the development of metrics that will help measure productivity?
* Doies the organizational structure allow temas to own goals and feel empowered and capable of meeting them?
* Whick types of conflict arise, and will that conflict help or hinder the mission of the organization?
* How does this organization structure help or hinder the time to market for my products?
* How does this organization structure increases or decrease the cost per unit of value created?
* Does work flows easily through the organization, or is it easily contained within a portion of the organization?

It is very difficult to increase the amount of work done by an organization if the structure does not allow for bringing in more peopl o perform additional work.

Organizational output: function of both size and efficiency (output per individual). Sometimes the means of achieving great output isn't "more people" but rather "more work per person" or "more total output at the same team size".

#### Conflicts

**Affective** ("bad") conflict is role- or control-based conflict and often arises between teams. This type of conflict is often about "who" does something or "how" something will be done. In organizational structures where multiple groups are necessary to deliver a product, the real question may be about "who" gets to define "when" something is ready to launch or "how" it should be developed to meet customer needs. 

Affective cnflict rarely adds alue to the products.

Cognitive conflict: if handled properly "good conflict" adds value. It is related to "why" something must happen or "what" a company needs to do to achieve some desired outcome.


Reducing affective conflict is key to succeed.  To reduce it, we want cross-functional teams capable of owning the outcome to a goal in its entirety.

Organizational structure and the cost per unit of value created brings up the issue of what we like to call the "organizational cost of scale" ->  communication overhead associated with the addition of each new team member to the project.  The more people you add to a project or task, the greater the overhead per person in commincation and coordination cost.

The more people within your company, group, or team, the more time you must spend reading and deleting emails as well as going to meetings rather than doing "real" work. 

Solution: **One possibility is to add management to limit nonessential coordination. Another possibility is to limit the interactions between individuals by creating smaller self-sufficient teams.**

Agile processes and functionality oriented teams working on monolithic, highly interdependant architectures can run into as many problems as waterfall processes with cross-functional teams working on largely independent and horizontal scaled product architectures.

To be successful, teams must be empowered to achieve their goal. Furthermore, each team must be given on or more key performance indicators (KPIs) that are indicative of overall success. The teams are often staffed cross-functionally so they have the skills necessary to achieve their KPIs without outside help.


### Leadership and Management

Most of the managers within product organizatios learn how to manage and how to lead informally. This general "life as a lab" approach is how we have developer managers for years.

Leadership sets a destination and "waypoints" towards that destination. Management then gets you to that destination.
Leadership -> "We will never have scalablity-related downtime in our-systems". 
Management -> ensuring that this scenario never happens.


Management is about pushing: Managers ensure that people are assigned to the appropriate tasks and that those tasks are completed within the specified interval and at an appropriate cost. It ensures that people get performance-oriented feedback in a timely manner and that the feedback includes both praise for great performance and information about areas needing improvement.

Management focuses on measuring and improving everything that ultimately creates shareholder value, such as reducing the cost to perform an activity or increasing the throughput of an activity at the same cost. Management means communicating status early and often, and clearly identify what is on track and where help is needed. Management activities also include removing obstacles or helping the team over or around obstacles where they occur on the path to an objective.

Ensuring that the team operates cohesively and effectively, includes the proper mix of skills, and has the appropriate experiences to be successful.  **Failure to measure if a failure to manage**

Leadership focuses on "pulling": leadership is aboud selecting the hill to take and surmounting it first. Leadership is about inspiring people and organizations to be better and to do great things. It creates a compelling vision that tugs on the heartstrings of employees and pulls them to do the right things for the company. Leadership identifies a mission that helps codify the vision and develop a casual mental roadmap that helps employees understand how what they do creates value for the shareholders. Finally, leadership defined the objectives to be met on the path towards the organization's goals and established KPIs.

Great leaders create a culture focused on ensureing success thorugh highly scalable organizations, processes, and products.

### In summary

* People are the most important piece of the puzzle.
* **The right person in the right job at the right time** and with the right behavious is essential to scale organizations, processes, and systems.
* Organizational structures are rarely "right or wrong". Any structure is likely to have pros and cons relative to the needs.
* Adding people to organizations may increase the organizational throughput, but the average production per individual tends to decline.
* Management is about achieving goals. A lack of management is nearly certain to doom your scalability initiatives.
* Leadership is about goal definition, vision creation, and mission articulation. An absence of leadership as it relates to scale is detrimental to your objectives.

## Leadership 101

If you can't lead or fail to make the right leadership decisions, you won't scale your solutions in time to meet customer demands.

### What is leadership

Leadership: "influencing the behavior of an organization or a person to accomplish a specific objective." -> pulling activity -> pulls the organization towards a goal.

You can lead peers, people in the organization, and even your management. Project managers, for instance, can "lead" a project team without being the person responsible for writing the reviews of the members of that team.

Leadership is about what you do and how you influence the behaviors of those people around you, for better or worse.

Both leadership and management are also necessary to varying degrees in the accomplishment of most objectives.

#### Leaders: Born or made?

A person's ability to lead is a direct results of his or her ability to influence behaviour in individuals and organizations. That ability to influence behaviour is a result of several things, some of which are traits with which a person is born, some of which are a result of the enviromnet, and so e of which are easily modified tools and approaches the person has developed over time.

Looks, Charisma, presence, charm, and personality are just a few of the many components of leadership; although they help, other components are just as important in establishing a leader's influence. 

### Leadership: A conceptual model

Perception (and its effect on the team you are leading) affects your capability to influence as a leader. 

There is a say, "Perception is reality" => "Leaders are under a microscope" => When you are a leader, everyone is watching you all of the time, and they will see you in your weakest moment and form an opinion of you based on that. Get used to it.

Sometimes it is inevitable that someone is going to catch you at a low point in your day, and that something may not even be bad but taken out of context. Be aware of this reality, and attempt as best you can to limit the number of "low points" that you have in any given day. 

### Taking stock of who you are

You can lead entirely the wrong way and still be successful, which encourages you to (mistakenly) associate that success with your leadership approach.

The Dunning-Kruger effect would argue, you probably aren't the best person to evaluate where you are today. All of us have a tendency to inflate certain self-perceived strengths and potentially even misdiagnose weakness.

Take feedback: one of the best ways to get feedback is through the 36-degree review process. Also, once you have received feedback say "Thanks for the input; here's wat I have heard and how I can improve". It will go a long way towards creating respect. Add "And here is how I'am going to take action to improve myself." will go even further.

Your plan should include both a reliance on and strengthening of your strengths and a mitigation of your weaknesses.


### Leading from the Front

Evaluate the cultural norms that you expect of your team and determine once again whether you are behaving consistently with these cultural norms.

People who are perceived to be great leaders don't abuse their position, and they don't assume that their progression to their positions allows them certain luxuries not afforded to the rest of the organization.

Everyone can increase the value of his or her leadership score by "leading from the front". Act and behave ethically and do not take advantage on your position of authority.

### Checking your ego at the door

The best leader give of themselves selflessly in an ethical pursuit of creating shareholder value. The right way to approach your job as a leader and a manager is to figure out how to get most out of your team so as to maximize shareholder wealth.

### Mission first, People always

Neither getting the job done at all costs nor caring about your people makes a great leader; great leaders know how to do both, even in light of their apparent contradictions.

Effective leaders and managers get the mission accomplished; great leaders and manager do so by creating a culture and environment in which people feel appreciated and respected and wherein performance-related feedback is honest and timely.

Caring about people means giving thought to the careers and interests of your employees; it means giving timely feedback on performance and, in so doing, recognizing that even stellar employees need feedback regarding infrequent poor performance. Great leaders ensure that those persons who create the most value are compensated most aggressively.

Caring also does not mean setting easy goals, as in so going you would not ber accomplishing your mission of creating shareholder value. The easies "People Always" test to apply for a seasoned leader is to find out how many direct reports have followed that manager consistently from position to position within successful organizations.

### Making timely, sound, and morally correct decisions

On average, you should move quickly to make the best decisions possible with the proper input without wasting a lot of time. Be courageous and make decisions. That's what being a leader is entirely about.

Lesson: "What you allow, you teach, and what you teach becomes your standard."

### Empowering teamsn and scalability

Empowerment is the distributions of certain actions, accountability, and ownership. It may include giving some or all components of both leadership and management to an individual or an organization.


The leadership aspects of empowerment come from the boost that individuals, teams, leaders, and managers get out of the feeling and associated pride of ownership. Individuals who believe they are empowered to make decisions and own a process in general are more productive than those who believe they are merely following orders.

When empowerment happens in statement only, such as when a leader continues to review all decisions for a certain project or initiative that has been given to an empowered team, the effects are disastrous. The leader may indicate that he is empowering people, but in actuality he is constraining the organizational throughput by creating a chokepoint of activity. The teams immediately see through this ruse; rather than owning the solution, they feel as though they are merely consultants to the process. Worse yet, they feel absolutely no ownership and as a results neither experience the gratigication that comes with owning a solution nor feel the obligation to ensure that the solution is implemented properly or the division run well.

=> this is not to say that in empowering individuals and teams, the leader is no longer responsible for the results. Although the leader may distribute ownership, that individual can never abdicate the responsibility to achieve results for shareholders.

### Alignment with Shareholder value
Everything you do as a leader and manager needs to be aligned with shareholder value. Always ask the question: "How does this create and maximize shareholder wealth"

### Transformational Leaderhship

The most effective ledaers indluence organizations through ideals, put aside their own self-interest in favor or that of the team, provide intellectual stimulation for the team and its members, and display honest and personal consideration for the team members well-being and their careers.

In contrast with "Transactional" or _quid pro quo_ leadership, which comes in the form of "If you accomplish goal X, I will give you reward Y."

Transformational leaderhips scaled better than "transactional" leadership. Rather than focusing on transactions with individuales, it focuses on the team. Rather than emphasizing oneself, it discusses the great good. What might otherwise become a discussion with a single individual now becomes ad discussion about what the team should aspire to be and accomplish. Transformational leadership focuses on presenting a compelling vision that pulls individuals to the right results even when the leader isn't present. It reduces affective conflict and increases value creating conflict.

### vision

Leaders don't spend enough time on vision and mission.

You vision is your destination; it's something that should inspire people within your company, attract outside talent, help retain the best of your current talent, and help people understand what they should be doing in the absence of a manager standing over their shoulders.

Visions is the description of a destination for a company, an organization, or an initiative. **It is a vivid description of the ideal future** -- the desired state or outcome in a clearly defined, measurable, and easily committed to memory package.

It should be measurable and testable, meaning that there is an easy way to determine whether you are actually at that point when you get there. It should also incorporate some portion of your beliefs so that it has meaning to the organization.

Perhaps the easiest way to envision a vision statement is to view it within the context of giving someone directions.

A vision statement should meet the following criteria:

* Vivid decription of an ideal future
* Important to value creation
* measurable
* inspirational
* Incorporate elements of your beliefs
* Mostly static, but modifiable as the need presents itself
* Easily remembered

### Mission

If vision is the vivid description of the ideal future or the end point of our journey, mission is the general path or actions that will get us to that destination. **The mission statement focuses more on the present state of the company, as that present state is important to get to the desired state or "vision" of the company**.

It should incorporate a sense of purpose, a sense of what needs to be done today, and a general direction regarding how to get to that vision. The mission statement should be testable -> the determination of whether, if properly executed, will help drive the initiative, organization, or company towards the vision of the company.

A mission statement should meet the following criteria:

* Be descriptive of the present state and actions
* Incorporate a sense of purpose
* Be measurable
* Include a general direction or path toward the vision


### Goals

Goals are the guideposts or mile markers to ensure that we stay on track during our journey. 

SMART goals:

* specific
* measurable 
* attainable
* realistic
* timely (timebound)

Specific in terms of "who", "what", and "where" and imply the "when". Goals don't tell someone "how" to do something, but rather indicate whether that person is on track. Explaining the path to a goal or vision is a management activity. 


Vision  --> Mission --> Goal

### The Casual roadmap to success

One of the best and easiest things that you can do as a leader to help ensure success within an organization is help people understand how what they do every day contributes to the vision of the organization and, as a result, to the creation of shareholder value. We call this creation  of understanding the _casual roadmap to success_.

Sample roadmap to success for roles:

Operation teams are responsible for helping to ensure that solutions or services are available, thereby keeping the company from experiencing lost opportunity.

Quality assurance professionals help reduce lost oppportunities associated with the deployment of a product and the cost of developing that product. 

One-on-one discussions should take place between a leader and each member of the team about this relationship. A manager of individual contributors should speak to each and every one of his or her employees. The director, in turn, should speak to each of his or her managers, the VP to each of his or her directors, and so on.

This isn't a one-time conversations. It's also not really focused on delivering performance feedback, but rather on ensuring that the persona has purpose and meaning within his or her job. The impact on retention from such reminders is meaningful, and it can potentially help employees product more. A happy employee, after all, is a productive employee -- and a productive employee is producing more to help you scale more.


### In summary

Leadership can impact the scalability of your team and you company in many ways. Poor leadership puts limits on the growth and output of your company and your team. Great leadership, in contract, serves as an accelerator for growth, allowing organizations to grow in total size and in output per individual.

* Leaders influence the behaviour of an organization or a person to accomplish a specific objective.
* Leaders, wether born or made, can get better; in fact, the pursuit of getting better should be a lifelong goal.
* Leadership can be viewed as a function consisting of personal characteristics, skipps, experiences, actions, and approaches. Increasing any aspect increases your leadership "quotient".
* The first step in getting better as a leader is to know where you stand. To do so, get a 360-degree review from your employees, your peers, and your manager. 
* Lead as you would have people follow -- abide by the culture you wish to create.
* There is no place for ego when leading teams -- so check your ego at the door.
* Leadership should be a selfless endeavor.
* Mission first, People always. Get the job done on time, but ensure you are doing it while taking care of your people.
* Always be morally straight. What you allow, you teach, and what you teach becomes your standard.
* Align everything you do with shareholder value. Don't do things that don't create shareholder value.
* Transformational leaders focus on the team overall, not on individuals. Don't engage in leadership transactions with individuals (_quid pro quo_), but rather focus the team on collaboration and team outcomes.
* Vision is a vivid description of an ideal future
* Mission is the general path or actions that will get you to your vision. 
* Goals are the guideposts to your vision and are consistent with the path of your mission. 
* The casual roadmap to success will help you frame your vision, mission, and goals, and will help employees understand how they contribute to those goals and aid in the creation of shareholder value.
